# Contact keeper app

### This app is hosted on heroku: https://jklee-contact-keeper.herokuapp.com/login

## Introduction

Users can type the information (First name, Last Name, phone .etc) and hit the submit button to add a contact. This app is refactored base on the previous project which is deployed on: https://jklee-phonebook.netlify.app/. I added the backend database and connected the front-end, refined the User Interface (UI) to make this app more beautiful and functional.

## This app was built with following techs

React/ Node.js/ Context API/ REST API/ Axios
